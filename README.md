# Chat Application
Hello there :wave: :grinning:. 
<br><br>
This is basically an application for chating .<br><br>
There is a global group chat that allows all users converse but users may also chat privately if they want to.<br><br>
The app was written majorly using Socket.io, MongoDB,and Node.js of course<br><br>
The application is active on heroku at  <a href=" https://lanrechat.herokuapp.com/">https://lanrechat.herokuapp.com </a> <br><br>
Kindly sign up and use it to discuss any kind of business. 
<br><br>
NOTE: You might have already noticed the "impressive" UI. Well this project is primarily to showcase my skills as a backend developer. I'll however update it to look a lot better soon
<br><br>You can contact me at lojetokun@gmail.com. See ya :wink:

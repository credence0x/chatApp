# chatApp
Hello. 
<br><br>
This is an application that enables all users chat publicly.<br><br>
Users may also chat privately.<br><br>
It was made majorly using socket.io,mongodb,and node.js of course<br><br>
The application is active on heroku on  <a href=" https://lanrechat.herokuapp.com/">https://lanrechat.herokuapp.com </a> <br><br>
Kindly sign up and use it to discuss business you don't want Mark Zuckerberg to ease drop on. 
<br><br>
NOTE: I am primarily a backend developer and this is to show what I can build in 24 hours so only minimal css and HTML is used. I'll however update it to look a lot better soon
